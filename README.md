# Articulus

> Connect rigid bodies with joints to build machines and vehicles in this physics sandbox

## Tech

- [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io) - game engine
- [Matter](https://brm.io/matter-js) - physics engine
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io) - PostgreSQL database hosting + api
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React & Webpack framework

## TODO

- New types of physics objects!
  - sticky wheel
  - magnets
  - controllable wheels
  - piston
- dynamic terrain e.g. move along path
- premade levels
- add goal e.g. get the thing to the end
- scoring system (time? object count?)
- user login system
- high score system
- Show user that object placement is invalid _while_ placing/dragging object
- editable polygon vertices
- undo/redo capability

## Work in progress

- ability to save & load builds
- Start/menu screens
- thrusters

## Known bugs

- grid snapping is slighly offset (uses object's center point instead of top-left)
- resizing multiple rotated shapes is not exact

## Credits

- inspired by the flash game [Fantastic Contraption](http://fantasticcontraption.com/original/).
