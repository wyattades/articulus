# Articulus

> Connect rigid bodies with joints to build machines and vehicles in this physics sandbox

## Tech

- [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io) - game engine
- [Matter](https://brm.io/matter-js) - physics engine
- [Supabase](https://supabase.io) - PostgreSQL database hosting + api
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) - React framework

## TODO

- New types of physics objects!
  - sticky wheel
  - magnets
  - controllable wheels
  - piston
- dynamic terrain e.g. move along path, or as free bodies
- premade levels
- add goal e.g. get the thing to the end
- scoring system (time? object count?)
- user login system
- high score system
- show user that object placement is invalid _while_ placing/dragging object
- undo/redo capability
- copy/paste keyboard shortcuts
- multiplayer world
- add a start screen

## Work in progress

- ability to view and import from your saved builds
- user authentication
- thrusters

## Known bugs

- resizing multiple rotated shapes does not accurately skew the shapes
- can drag existing objects overtop other objects. this should be disallowed

## Credits

- inspired by the flash game [Fantastic Contraption](http://fantasticcontraption.com/original/).
