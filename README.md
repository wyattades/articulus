# Fantastic Contraption
> A sandbox physics game

## TODO
- Select/move tool
- Show user that object placement is invalid *while* placing/dragging object
- level editor
- premade levels
- add goal e.g. get the thing to the end
- scoring system (time? object count?)
- save levels & high scores in DB
- Start/menu screens

## BUGS
- deleting objects while game is running (i.e. not paused) may crash
