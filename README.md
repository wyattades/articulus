# Fantastic Contraption

> A sandbox physics game

## TODO

- New types of physics objects!
- premade levels
- add goal e.g. get the thing to the end
- scoring system (time? object count?)
- Start/menu screens (WIP)
- user login system
- high score system
- ability to save & load contraptions
- Show user that object placement is invalid _while_ placing/dragging object

## BUGS

- dragging while zoomed out is too slow
- grid snapping doesn't snap to the right grid
